# fastapi-secrets

## Getting started

An online test for python and fastapi...

1. Add different secret encodings than just SHA and make it possible to select the one you want to use.
2. Add a valid /auth endpoint that takes a token and validates it.
3. Add a persistent backend for the secrets rather than the current hash stored in memory.
4. Finally build and run the container and show you can access it via the /docs endpoint, show all the features above..
5. If needed create a docker-compose file if you want to run any other container along with this one.
